# Axosoft Editable Comments Chrome Plugin
Ever wish you could edit Axosoft Task Management comments? Now you can!

## TLDR: This Chrome Plugin allows for Double-Clicking a comment to make it editable.


## How to use?
1. Simply install it as a chrome browser plugin:

2. Double-Click on a comment to edit it.


## How does it actually work?
It works by simply automating what most of us do when we need to edit an Axo comment.
That is, creating a new comment with the original's text inside of the typical comment editor, and deleting the old comment upon saving the new.


## Why even build this?
We were using Axosoft project management software at my company.
The problem was that task comments wern't editable, so I hacked together this quick JS plugin to fix it.
